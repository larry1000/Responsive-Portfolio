      <p>   Hello, my name is Larry Lightner welcome to my page, The first thing I think about when I'm asked to write a paragraph about myself is that I'm horrible at writing paragraphs about myself.
         I’m a Mail Carrier who’s looking to break into the Software Development field. I’ve been a carrier for the last 10 years and before that, I obtained my Associate's degree in Information Technology from Bryant and Stratton College and I recently graduated from Southern New Hampshire University achieving my Bachelor’s degree in software development.</p> 
      <p>   While attending school on a full-time schedule, I was able to continue to work full-time while amassing a 3.85 GPA, and make multiple school president lists. My interest in the information technology field is what originally spark my return to school, my work ethic, intelligence, and determination is what allowed me to be successful in this endeavor. 
         In my free time which I get precious few of it, I enjoy reading about subjects that interest me the most like technology, astronomy, history, and fiction. </p>
